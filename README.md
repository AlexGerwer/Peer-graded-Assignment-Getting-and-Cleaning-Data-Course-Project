##Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Project description

    The goal of the project was to use data collected from accelerometers from
    the Samsung Galaxy S and transform it to prepare a clean dataset that can be
    used for further analysis. Please see the Codebook.md for more details on
    the original dataset and well as all the transformations made to it.

Relevant Files

    CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any
    transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
    run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5
    steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
        Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        Extracts only the mean and standard deviation for each feature.
        Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
        with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Steps to reproduce this project

    Download UCI HAR Dataset.zip to your working directory and unzip it
    Download run_analysis.R to your working directory
    Run run_analysis.R
    Tidy_data.txt will be generated in your working directory
